# E-Commerce-Back-End

This project creates an e-commerce database and displays it out in JSON format using Insomnia. This project also uses the MySQL2, Sequelize, and Express packages within Node.js to run the commands. In addition, a .env file is used to store MySQL credentials and is in the gitignore folder. 

After MySQL has been connected and the schema file is sourced, the server is then started up and Insomnia is then used to display the data that falls into the following groups of Category, Product and Tag. The data is then displayed on Insonnia using the GET request. Data can be added using the POST request, edited with the PUT request, or deleted using the DELETE request and those results are then updated using Insomnia.

There are two videos linked below. One demonstrates connecting to the database and seeding the data. The other video demonstrates, retrieving, updating and displaying the data using Insomnia.
